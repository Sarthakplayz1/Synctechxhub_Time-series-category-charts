# Synctechxhub – Time Series & Category Charts

In this project, I explored the Superstore sales dataset to understand how sales change over time and how different product categories perform.

The goal was to analyze sales trends, identify patterns, and generate meaningful business insights using Python.

# What I Did

- Analyzed sales trends over time  
- Calculated monthly and quarterly sales to identify growth patterns  
- Compared performance across product categories and regions  
- Visualized category contribution using pie charts  
- Generated automated summary insights  

# Visualizations Used

- Line charts to show time-series sales trends  
- 3-month rolling average to highlight long-term patterns  
- Bar charts to compare categories and regions  
- Horizontal bar charts for detailed sub-category analysis  
- Pie chart to understand category share  

# Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab  

This project helped strengthen my understanding of time-series analysis, data aggregation, and data visualization while generating practical business insights.
